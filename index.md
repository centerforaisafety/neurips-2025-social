## RFP: Open-Weight Model Safeguards (Closes Dec 7)
The Center for AI Safety is running [an RFP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_nISYFk2wsCYTVXFTN-PHmUC9YN4C0FBgoOBp7bmE2A) aimed at safeguarding open-weight models.

We plan to award $350,000 total to grantees. Funding will be provided as on-demand compute credits to the CAIS Compute Cluster. The number of funded proposals will depend on the quality and compute requirements of submissions.

We will consider proposals in the following areas:
- Training data filtering/curation
- Defenses against adversarial fine-tuning, including tamper-resistant safeguards, circuit breakers, robust unlearning, etc.
- Model tampering evaluations
- Preventing unauthorized distillation/compression of models
- Staged deployment strategies
- Model provenance/forensics techniques

### Timeline
- RFP Window: Nov 7 to Dec 7, 2025
- Award Notifications: Dec 12, 2025
- Awards Disbursed: Dec 19, 2025
- Research Period: December 2025 to June 2026

Proposals will be evaluated based on relevance to the RFP topics, technical feasibility, potential impact, and compute requirements.

Grantees will be expected to submit results from their project to the Center for AI Safety and share these publicly as a preprint article by the end of the research period.

To submit a proposal, please fill out this [short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_nISYFk2wsCYTVXFTN-PHmUC9YN4C0FBgoOBp7bmE2A). Applications will be accepted until December 7, 2025.
